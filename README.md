<p align="center">You're asking yourself what Transport actually is? Let us explain it to you - it won't take long, we promise.</p>


<h4>What actually is Transport?</h4>
<p>Transport is a client for managing your servers and transferring your files. Packed in a stylish design you have the ability to work fast and efficient. Beside the file transfer over FTP, FTPS and SFTP there is also the opportunity to directly manage your server over SSH. This happens with the integrated shell which will open automatically when you connect to a server over SFTP.</p>

<ul>
<li><h5>FTP-, FTPS- and SFTP software put together with an integrated shell</h5></li>
<p>As soon as you connect to a SFTP-Server you have the opportunity to open a docked window which directly shows a SSH terminal to your server</p>

<li><h5>Eye-friendly dark mode</h5></li>
<p>Light design-elements can be very exhausting together with a dark envirornment. A simple setting eliminates this problem. The design changes from exciting light to a calmed dark.</p>

<li><h5>Security counts</h5></li>
<p>Beside authorization methods like a password or a SSH key, there will be also an opportunity to sign in on your server with a U2F-enabled device like a YubiKey.</p>

<li><h5>No monthly costs</h5></li>
<p>You only pay a small amount once.</p>

<li><h5>Integrated VNC client</h5></li>
<p>You can connect to your server over VNC too. You can easily check the status of your server if you've lost for example your password or your SSH key.</p>

<li><h5>Themes</h5></li>
<p>Change the whole design of Transport according to your preferences. You only need a small knowledge of CSS. Afterwards you can export the created Theme and use it in other Transport clients.</p>
</ul>
